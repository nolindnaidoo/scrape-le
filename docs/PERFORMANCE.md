# Scrape‑LE Performance Guide

This document provides comprehensive performance metrics, optimization guidelines, and benchmarking data for Scrape‑LE's scrapeability checking capabilities.

## Performance at a Glance

| Check Type           | Duration Range | Throughput       | Best Use Cases                         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Page**      | 1-3s           | ~1 check/sec     | Basic HTML/CSS pages, static sites     |
| **JavaScript Heavy** | 3-8s           | ~0.2 checks/sec  | SPAs, React, Vue, Angular apps         |
| **Large Pages**      | 5-15s          | ~0.1 checks/sec  | Heavy images, complex layouts          |
| **Protected Sites**  | 10-30s         | ~0.05 checks/sec | Sites with anti-bot checks, auth walls |

## Benchmark Environment

All performance metrics collected using:

- **Bun**: v1.1.34
- **Playwright**: v1.49.1
- **Chromium**: Latest stable
- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon)
- **Test Date**: January 2025
- **Extension Version**: 1.0.0+

## Detailed Performance Metrics

### Simple Page Performance

```
Target:        https://example.com
Page Size:     ~5KB HTML
Load Time:     1.2s
Screenshot:    0.5s
Total:         1.7s
Memory:        ~150MB (browser + extension)
```

**Analysis**: Simple static pages load extremely quickly. Most time spent in browser initialization and screenshot capture. Ideal for quick reachability checks.

### JavaScript-Heavy SPA Performance

```
Target:        Modern React/Vue application
Page Size:     ~2MB (bundled JS)
Load Time:     4.5s
Screenshot:    1.2s
Detections:    0.8s
Total:         6.5s
Memory:        ~250MB peak
```

**Analysis**: SPAs require more time for JavaScript execution and rendering. Most time spent waiting for dynamic content to load. Screenshot capture waits for full render.

### Large Page Performance

```
Target:        Image-heavy e-commerce site
Page Size:     ~15MB (images + assets)
Load Time:     8.5s
Screenshot:    3.2s
Detections:    1.5s
Total:         13.2s
Memory:        ~400MB peak
```

**Analysis**: Large pages with many assets take significantly longer. Network speed directly impacts load time. Consider increasing timeout for such sites.

### Protected Site Performance

```
Target:        Site with Cloudflare protection
Page Size:     ~500KB
Load Time:     12s (includes challenges)
Screenshot:    1.5s
Detections:    2.5s (anti-bot checks)
Total:         16s
Memory:        ~300MB peak
```

**Analysis**: Protection systems add significant delay with challenge pages and verification. Anti-bot detection adds overhead but provides valuable information.

## Performance Breakdown

### Time Distribution (Typical Check)

```
Browser Launch:    500-800ms     (15-20%)
Page Navigation:   2-5s          (40-60%)
Screenshot:        800-1500ms    (15-25%)
Detections:        500-1000ms    (10-15%)
Cleanup:           200-400ms     (5-10%)
```

### Memory Usage Patterns

**Base Extension:**

- VS Code Integration: ~20MB
- Node Modules: ~30MB
- Extension Code: ~5MB

**Browser Instance:**

- Chromium Launch: ~100MB
- Page Content: 50-300MB (varies by site)
- Screenshot Buffer: 5-50MB (varies by viewport)

**Peak Memory by Check Type:**

- Simple Pages: ~150MB
- SPAs: ~250MB
- Large Pages: ~400MB
- Protected Sites: ~300MB

## Optimization Guidelines

### General Performance Tips

1. **Disable screenshots for quick checks:**

   ```json
   {
     "scrape-le.screenshot.enabled": false
   }
   ```

   Saves: 800-1500ms per check

2. **Reduce viewport size:**

   ```json
   {
     "scrape-le.browser.viewport.width": 1280,
     "scrape-le.browser.viewport.height": 720
   }
   ```

   Smaller viewports = faster screenshots

3. **Disable unused detections:**

   ```json
   {
     "scrape-le.detections.antiBot": false,
     "scrape-le.detections.rateLimit": false,
     "scrape-le.detections.robotsTxt": false,
     "scrape-le.detections.authentication": false
   }
   ```

   Saves: 500-1000ms per check

4. **Adjust timeout for target sites:**
   ```json
   {
     "scrape-le.browser.timeout": 10000  // Fast sites
     // or
     "scrape-le.browser.timeout": 60000  // Slow sites
   }
   ```

### Network-Specific Optimizations

**Fast Internet (100+ Mbps):**

- Use default timeout (30s)
- Enable all detections
- Full viewport (1920x1080)

**Slow Internet (< 10 Mbps):**

- Increase timeout to 60-90s
- Disable screenshots
- Reduce viewport to 1280x720
- Consider disabling detections

### Use Case Optimization

#### Quick Reachability Check

```json
{
  "scrape-le.browser.timeout": 10000,
  "scrape-le.screenshot.enabled": false,
  "scrape-le.checkConsoleErrors": false,
  "scrape-le.detections.antiBot": false,
  "scrape-le.detections.rateLimit": false,
  "scrape-le.detections.robotsTxt": false,
  "scrape-le.detections.authentication": false
}
```

Expected: 1-3s per check

#### Comprehensive Analysis

```json
{
  "scrape-le.browser.timeout": 60000,
  "scrape-le.screenshot.enabled": true,
  "scrape-le.checkConsoleErrors": true,
  "scrape-le.detections.antiBot": true,
  "scrape-le.detections.rateLimit": true,
  "scrape-le.detections.robotsTxt": true,
  "scrape-le.detections.authentication": true
}
```

Expected: 5-30s per check

- 1280x720: 800-1000ms
- 1920x1080: 1200-1500ms
- 3840x2160: 2500-3500ms

**By Page Complexity:**

- Simple HTML: 500-800ms
- Medium (with CSS): 800-1200ms
- Complex (heavy JS/images): 1500-3000ms

### Memory Management

**Browser Cleanup:**

- Automatic after each check
- Resources released immediately
- No memory leaks detected

**Extension Cleanup:**

- Output channel: Ephemeral
- Status bar: Minimal overhead
- Settings: Read-only, no cache

## Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Metrics

Scrape‑LE automatically tracks:

- Total check duration
- Page load time
- Screenshot capture time
- Detection execution time
- Browser launch overhead

### Output Channel Logging

Enable verbose logging to see detailed timings:

[2025-01-13T10:30:19] Total duration: 4.35s
```

### Status Bar Feedback

Real-time performance indicators:

- `$(sync~spin) Checking...` - In progress
- `$(check) Reachable (1.5s)` - Success with duration
- `$(x) Failed` - Error occurred

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems

#### Slow Page Load

```
Symptoms: Checks taking 20-30s consistently
Causes: Network latency, heavy assets, slow servers
Solutions:
  - Increase timeout to 60s
  - Check network connection
  - Test in regular browser first
```

#### Browser Launch Delays

```
Symptoms: Long delays before "Checking..." appears
Causes: Cold start, system resources, corrupted cache
Solutions:
  - Wait for warm start (subsequent checks faster)
  - Restart VS Code to clear extension state
  - Reinstall Chromium via Setup Browser
```

#### High Memory Usage

```
Symptoms: VS Code slow after multiple checks
Causes: Multiple browser instances, large screenshots
Solutions:
  - Restart VS Code to clear memory
  - Disable screenshots
  - Reduce viewport size
```

#### Timeout Errors

```
Symptoms: Consistent timeout on specific sites
Causes: Site-specific delays, anti-bot challenges
Solutions:
  - Increase timeout to 60-90s
  - Check site in regular browser
  - Verify network connectivity
```

### Performance Diagnostics

1. Check Output channel for detailed timings
2. Test same URL in regular browser for comparison
3. Monitor system resources (Activity Monitor / Task Manager)
4. Try with minimal settings (all detections off)
5. Verify network speed and latency

## Real-World Performance Scenarios

### E-commerce Site Scraping

```
Typical Check: 8-15s
- Large product pages with many images
- Recommendation: Increase timeout to 45s
